# Assistants Safe Storage

A tool to encrypt and decrypt a token using a special key selected by the user. Without knowing the key, decrypt tokens are not possible. Any token change, or attempt to access the database using the wrong key, results in a database reset.

The module is used by the [Discord-Dashboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-dashboard) module to store access_tokens securely, allowing us to extend the capabilities of the Dashboard.
